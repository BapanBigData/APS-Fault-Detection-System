# APS-Fault-Detection-System
 This project develops a binary classification model to detect faults in the Air Pressure System (APS) of heavy-duty trucks, which generates pressurized air for braking and gear changes. The model categorizes failures as APS-related (positive class) or non-APS-related (negative class), with the goal of improving vehicle reliability and safety.
